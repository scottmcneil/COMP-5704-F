<p>One of the challenges of General Programming with Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU) is overcoming the high latency of memory access between the off-chip DRAM and the processing units. Linear algebra problems typically provide a sufficient work-to-memory access ratio but, when operating on many small matrices or vectors, this may not be the case. Recent research and architecture developments present opporunities for overcoming these hurdles.</p>

<p>Cluster robust variance estimation (CRVE) is a statistical technique for correcting in- ference when variance is correlated within groups. It is an important and often underused technique for econometric analysis. The calculation of the CRVE itself is not particularly expensive but there are two scenarios when the CRVE is re-calculated many times. First, the CRVE has shown to be best when combined with bootstrap resampling, specifically the wild cluster bootstrap (WCB), which involves recalculating the CRVE hundreds if not thousands of times. Secondly, reasoning about the CRVE often involves Monte Carlo simulations with tens of thousands of replications.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, the relevant problem is of the ”embarassingly parallel” variety—meaning a GPU implementation could provide considerable benefits. There are challenges, however, to optimizing the CRVE on a GPU. First, the CRVE requires calcu- lating many independent matrix-vector and vector-vector products. Further, data from the first set of independent problems (matrix-vector product) must be re-used in a second and third (vector-vector multiplication and summation).</p>

<p>Recent research has shown that even small, independent linear algebra problems can be optimized on the GPU, especially via batched processing. However, using current batched implementations for the CRVE would mean needlessly moving data in and out of global memory on the GPU. Another recent development is the addition of the warp-shuffle instruction to NVIDIA GPUs via Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This has been shown to considerably reducde latency when data needs to be shared among threads. This paper will present an implementation that combines the approaches draws on existing batched implementations while making use of the warp-shuffle. All of the GPU results presented here were computed using an NVIDIA K80 GPU from Amazon Web Services. All CPU results were computed with a Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 (Broadwell) Processors, also from Amazon Web Services.</p>
